### Group discussion on chosen language

Since our bachelor thesis involved developing a React web-application we had very limited
choices with regards to programming languages we would use, which is JavaScript ES6. The exception is for the back-end
where we could choose more freely, however we chose that our entire application, both back-end and front-end would be
written in Javascript. We regarded this as a big strength already as we only needed to focus on one language and use
JSON seamlessly between the front-end and back-end.
